# Flights-Data-Analysis-

1.) Introduction:
The Executives of Dulles International Airport have seen that the Flight Delays play an important role in the profitability, operations, customer satisfaction 
of the airport. And it is necessary to keep track of the delays and the factors affecting the delay as it will enables the executives to run the airport operations more smoothly and effectively to increase profits and customer satisfaction.

The Goal of this analysis is to see what factors are affecting the flight arrival delays and to what extent. This analysis would enable us to know what causes a delay, where does it cause the delaying of flight, when does it cause a delay, so that effective recommendations can be made.

2.) Highlights and Key Findings:

Flights those arrive at the destination airport at least 15 minutes late than the scheduled arrival time are considered to be delayed. So considering that, it is seen that the most monthly delays in proportion to the no. of flights taking off in that particular month have occurred during the month of December which is 24.2%. 
And the lowest is found to be in the month of November i.e., 9.2%. Further, it was found that the weekday which has the highest percentage of flight arrival delay in proportion to the total flights taking off on that day is Thursday having 17.8% flights getting delayed. Moreover, the days of the month were also analysed to know the trend of flight arrival delays throughout the month. So, it is seen that, mid of the months were more prone to flights arrival delays as compared to any other day, 15th and the 16th day don't show a significant difference, 15th day being the highest.

Additionally, it is seen that the destination airport region more prone to delays is the Northeast region where 18.5% of Flights arrive late out of all the flights flown to that region. This leads us to think of the Destination airports facing arrival delays, and "Portland Jetport" is more susceptible to arrival delays than any other airport. And looking at the data, it can be seen that "Portland Jetport" falls in the Northeast region itself.

Furthermore, the Airlines also play a major factor in determining flight arrival delays, and from the analysis it is found that "Frontier Airlines" faced highest arrival delay percentages i.e., 27.02%. The factors that affected the arrival delays were also analyzed and it was found that departure delays affected the most i.e. it showed the correlation of 0.96 with arrival delay. While there were no other significant correlations seen, correlation between taxi_out and arrival delays(0.28), though smaller, was seen. Also, considering climate as one factor, a small correlation was seen between Precipitation and Arrival Delays(0.16).Traffic at runway is also a big concern that increases further delay, and it was seen that "United and "American" Airlines were associated with the highest average taxi_out times in minutes.


3.) Recommendations:

Firstly, considering the monthly Delays, highest delays were seen in the Months of December and July. The possible reason for the delays in those months would be due to high precipitations.So considering this factor, preparations can be made by the airports to monitor the weather forecasting thoroughly and schedule the flights accordingly.

Secondly, December is considered as a holiday season, hence, more people travel during this month. To minimize the delays, one of the recommendations would be making security check process more fast and streamlined, if there is a need, put more employees, in this process to get the work done.
Now, coming to the weekly delays, Thursdays and Mondays have highest delays, this may be due to the working class people travelling to and from their work on those days, increasing the congestion in the airports, resulting into higher check in times. This can be reduced by properly managing the distributions of employees and check in counters and increasing the queues for check in for those days.

Frontier Airlines and Skywest Airlines have the highest average Taxi-out times, to which, one of my recommendation would be to improve the flight operations and get rid of the Taxi checklist to let the pilots focus on taxiing efficiently.
